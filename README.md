# COMP702Project
# Instructions:
# 1. This code can be executed in Google Colab, as it was created as a Notebook and can easily be executed there.
# 2. The Leafsnap dataset [1] used in this program is accessible through the dataset folder on my google drive, which is accessible using
# this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gnxRaR8HVx3SiFXvbAIggdMT2LU4oNHN?usp=sharing that allows access publicly.
# Note: this folder contains the sub folders Test and Train which only contain a portion of Leafsnap images [1] which can be downloaded
# and the path reconfigured on Colab in case of access problems using the above mentioned link. The entire Leafsnap dataset can also be used
# if available on your personal Google Drive, or if the code is copied and pasted locally into a Python IDE with the specified path to the
# dataset and the change of the "Lab" image folder to "Train" and the "Field" image folder to "Test"
# 3. The CSV file for:
# Train.csv used for extracting training paths can also be accessed from: 
# https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PeUewKwgFcDGKWKXOUjdCMMvMZ_K1_ZA/view?usp=sharing
# Test.csv used for extracting training paths can also be accessed from: 
# https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rq4h7JxskP-EdCg38NhKj2bJ711G5TR7/view?usp=sharing
# 4. After mounting the location/path of the dataset in step 2 and mounting the location/path of the csv files
# in step 3, the code can be executed and results will be displayed after execution.
# 
# Last resort:
# The CSV files and a mini/subset of a very few sample Leafsnap images [1] will be uploaded in this repo as well as in their
# appropriate folders for access by the code, if run locally with the files downloaded.
